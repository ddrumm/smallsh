# smallsh

A simple Unix shell implementation that includes some basic shell features.

These features are: built-in cd (change directory) and status commands, support for running processes in foreground or background, foreground only mode enabled by SIGSTOP signal, input and output redirection, and variable expansion for one specific variable.
